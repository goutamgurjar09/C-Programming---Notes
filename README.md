# C-Programming-Notes
1.what is c++?
    
    C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 
    the early 1980s at Bell Labs as an enhancement to C to provide object-oriented programming features. 
    C++ is a versatile language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from 
    system programming to building desktop applications, games, and more.

# C++ Features:-

  ->C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 
    1980 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic 
    programming styles.

  ->C++ is a simple language because it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), a rich set of library functions, data types, etc.
 
  ->C++ is a portable language and programs made in it can be run on different machines.
  
  ->C++ includes both low-level programming and high-level language so it is known as a mid-level and intermediate programming language. It is used to develop system 
    applications such as kernel, driver, etc.
  
  ->C++ is known as hybrid language because C++ supports both procedural and object oriented programming paradigms.
 
  ->C++ provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make the development fast. Following are the libraries used in C++ programming are:
    <iostream>,<cmath>,<cstdlib>,<fstream> 
  
  ->C++ provides the feature of pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array, etc. We can directly interact with the memory by using the 
    pointers.
  
  ->In C++, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function.
  
  ->Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods and properties for 
    these objects.
    In C++, object-oriented concepts like data hiding, encapsulation, and data abstraction can easily be implemented using keyword class, private, public, and 
    protected access specifiers. Object-oriented makes development and maintenance easier.
   
   ->C++ is a compiler-based programming language, which means no C++ program can be executed without compilation.

   ->Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.

   ->Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and 
     effective code.

   ->Exception Handling: C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations.

   ->C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for learning and using the language.

   ->Platform Independent: C++ is a platform-independent language, meaning that code written in C++ can be compiled and run on a wide range of platforms, from desktop 
     computers to mobile devices.

   ->Performance: C++ is a compiled language, which means that its code is compiled into machine-readable code, making it one of the fastest programming languages.
   
# First program c++:-
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
    	std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    	return 0;
    }

# Difference between C and C++ :-

                   C	                                                                  C++
                   
1)	C follows the procedural style programming.      	                C++ is multi-paradigm. It supports both procedural and object oriented.
2)	Data is less secured in C.	                                        In C++, you can use modifiers for class members to make it inaccessible for outside users.
3)	C follows the top-down approach.	                                C++ follows the bottom-up approach.
4)	C does not support function overloading.	                        C++ supports function overloading.
5)	In C, you can't use functions in structure.	                        In C++, you can use functions in structure.
6)	C does not support reference variables.	                            C++ supports reference variables.
7)	In C, scanf() and printf() are mainly used for input/output.	    C++ mainly uses stream cin and cout to perform input and output operations.
8)	Operator overloading is not possible in C.                          in C++ Operator overloading is possible .
9)	C programs are divided into procedures and modules	                C++ programs are divided into functions and classes.
10)	C does not provide the feature of namespace.	                    C++ supports the feature of namespace.
11)	Exception handling is not easy in C.                                C++ provides exception handling using Try and Catch block.
	It has to perform using other functions.	
13)	C does not support the inheritance.                              	C++ supports inheritance.
